OpenAI API Key
To use the AI Image Generator, you need an OpenAI API key. You can sign up for an account at OpenAI website and read their documentation on how to obtain an API key.

## Usage
Once you have set up the project and obtained the OpenAI API key, you are ready to generate images from text. Run the following command:


```python generate_image.py --input_text "A serene lake with mountains in the background."```
Replace the example text with your desired description. The AI will process the input text and create a stunning image based on it.

When using the generator, you can specify the desired image size as a parameter.

## Limitations
- Free OpenAI account: Up to 5 images can be generated at a time.
- Paid OpenAI account: Up to 50 images can be generated at a time.
- Image size options: Limited to 256x256, 512x512, and 1024x1024 pixels.
Keep in mind the limitations of your OpenAI account to manage your image generation needs effectively.
